  <a><hr>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa to her father, after he reprimands her for not being a "proper Japanese lady"
    A martial arts fanatic and a fan of Bruce Lee, Lisa uses her own fists to defend herself, equipping gloves to improve the force impact.
    
    She is one of the more popular girls at Seven Sisters High School, and is the self-proclaimed hottest girl in school. She harbors a crush for Tatsuya Suou because she thinks he is hot enough to boost her self-esteem. She holds an obvious crush on Tatsuya, acting clingy towards him and follows him around with little regard to his feelings on the matter.
    
    
    Lisa remembering being bullied for being different from the other children.
    
    Despite her appearance, Lisa usually acts cool to those she is not interested in, and even haughty to those she dislikes. This could be caused by the bullying and xenophobia she experienced from the other local children when she was very young.
    
    She rejects the role of a "traditional" Japanese woman imposed on her by her parents, and feels they are forcing their culture onto her. In response, as a form of rebellion, Lisa is learning to speak Cantonese (a form of Chinese) instead of Japanese. She often mixes both languages (often saying "Aiyah!" and other Chinese expressions). Lisa also engages in "dangerous" drug use and compensated dating with "dirty" older men for money.
