    Justin Bieber has been releasing banger after banger these days. Yes, “Purpose” was an unbelievable comeback album after a long hiatus, but his recent tracks have been even more incredible.

The thing about Justin Bieber is that you really never know what to expect from him as a person and as an artist. Whether it’s collaborating with music legend Chance the Rapper or working with various DJs to release singles, you never know what’s going to come next.

Take his most recent features, such as on “Deja Vu” by Post Malone. Many publications have compared the rhythmic track to Drake’s “Hotline Bling.” Bieber’s other recent appearance on DJ Snake’s “Let Me Love You” is a completely different sound, with more upbeat rhythms and higher vocals.

The point is, his persona is changing. As an artist he has become unpredictable, but in a respectable way. He can successfully master any kind of sound and collaborate with any kind of artist — and that is what I call talent.
